A simple five-star rating control, or 10 with half-stars, with basic style options. This was the first Extension Builder Widget that I created as a learning exercise, but it may be useful to someone. There is a minimal set of styling properties such as iconColor and iconHiliteColor.This is an example of how you can build new controls simply by putting SVG path drawing strings, exported from a drawing application such as Adobe Illustrator, into Extension Builder language arrays and then rendering them to the widgets view with very little other coding. The extension also includes a default mouseDown script that allows for the user to click and drag on the widget to set its amount of stars property.Exampleset the amountOfStars of widget FiveStar to 3.5
