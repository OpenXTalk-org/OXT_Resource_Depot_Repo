Simple five-star rating control,10 with half-stars, with basic style options.This was my first Widget, created as a learning exercise, but it may be useful to someone. There is a minimal set of properties such as iconColor and iconHiliteColor.This is an example of how you can build widgets simply by putting SVG path drawing strings, exported from a drawing application such as InkScape or Adobe Illustrator, into Extension Builder language arrays and then rendering them to the widgets view with very little other coding. The widget includes a default mouseDown script that can allows for the end user to click and drag on the widget to set its amount of stars property.Example:set the amountOfStars of widget FiveStar to 3.5
