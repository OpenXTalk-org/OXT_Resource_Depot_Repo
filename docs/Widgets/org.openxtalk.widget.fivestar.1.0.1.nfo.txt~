A simple 5-star rating control (10 possible with half-stars) with basic options. This was the first Extension Builder Widget that I created as a learning exercise, but it may be useful to someone. There is a minimal set of styling properties such as 'iconColor' and iconHiliteColor.This is an example of how you can build controls with Extension Builder simply by putting SVG path drawing strings, exported from a drawing application such as Adobe Illustrator, into Extension Builder language arrays and then rendering them to the widgets view with very little other coding.The extension also includes a default script that allows for the user to click on the widget to set its amount of stars property.Example usage:set the amountOfStars of widget FiveStar to 3.5
