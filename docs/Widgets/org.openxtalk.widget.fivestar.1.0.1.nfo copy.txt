First Widget I created, a simple '5-star rating' control.
Built as a learning experiment, you may still find it useful.
The control actually has ten possible states with half-stars ratings.
There is a minimal set of other properties such as iconColor and iconHiliteColor

Example usage:
set the amountOfStars of widget "FiveStar" to 3.5
